    "link": "https://sports.yahoo.com/nba/topic/wemby-watch/",
    "details": "This project involved creating and implementing new /topic/ pages on sports.yahoo.com to enhance user experience and boost SEO performance. Examples include topic/Wemby Watch and topic/Super Bowl, which provides content on specific sports topics. I designed the layouts for these pages, ensuring they worked seamlessly on both desktop and mobile. I translated UI/UX designs into web pages, focusing on user engagement and accessibility.",
    "tools": "JavaScript, React.js, Firebase, HTML, CSS",
    "time": "About 3-4 weeks",
    "issues": "The design and development teams disagreed on a new feature's complexity. To resolve this, I organized a meeting where both teams could talk over and bring suggestions to the table. We agreed on a compromise: a simplified version of the feature that met design goals and was feasible to develop. This approach allowed me to deliver the project on time while ensuring both teams were satisfied.",

    "title": "Stream Component and Pagination Implementation",
    "overview": "Added a new 'stream' component and pagination to every /league/news/ page, was under a feature flag when I got laid off for a controlled release, but I checked few days ago and they released it. Spent a lot of time planning, reviewing, debugging, and organizing this project.",
    "link": "https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news/",
    "details": "For this project, I integrated a new 'stream' component and pagination system on all /league/news/ url pages to improve user navigation and make it easier to browse news articles. The new 'stream' component dynamically loads content, giving users a continuous flow of news articles, enhancing their experience. I worked closely with cross-functional teams from all over the world to make sure the implementation met our product goals and user needs. Detailed planning, updating documentation, code reviews, and thorough debugging were key parts of it.",
    "time": "3-4 weeks",
    "issues": "Challenges included poorly maintained documentation, requiring adjustments to API calls, adding a special JSON request, passing additional parameters, and including special headers to properly read URLs.",
    "storage": "We were not caching because those articles would be updated from other sites as well, not yahoo.sports only, so we needed that constant update.",
